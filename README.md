# portfolio
This is my professional portfolio, this is my small-time exploratory/project into the vast space of FullStack (personally not heavily interested but I still), so this acts as my first open source project to build a portfolio that contains anything and everything about me. This is my first open-source project on GitHub (can't reveal my other account due to confidentiality). Enjoy :)
